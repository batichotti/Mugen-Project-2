<div align='center'> <h2>‚ùìPurpose </h2> </div>

Project created for the Programming Language 3 course based on a game developed for the Programming Language 2 course in Java, now incorporating SQL integration and new features.

The game and its mechanics are based on Undertale and Zelda, but with the mythology of the Jujutsu Kaisen universe (by Gege Akutami), featuring a battle system inspired by Pok√©mon and primarily utilizing pure Java. All pixel art was hand-drawn by me.
